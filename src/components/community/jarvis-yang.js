      Hello World, my name is Jarvis, and I code and stuff...
      <br />
      <br />
      I love to fix things, find bugs, troubleshoot code, and educate people. I
      have been described by my peers to be considerate, thorough, and detail
      oriented. Some of my key strengths include being gritty, creative, and
      having an aptitude for pattern mapping.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you need a good quality developer with real world experiences who just
      finished their full stack developer bootcamp, please feel free to contact
      me. I am also looking to marry quality assurance and full stack
      development and get into the automated and manual software testing world!
